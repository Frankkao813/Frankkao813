Hi, welcome to my repository! I am Franklin, currently a fourth year chemistry major student at NTU.

### Actively Learning:
* Statistics and linear algebra
* C++ programming language and data structure

### More complete repository

The repository that I think is more complete is as follows:
* NTU_knowledge_king: It is the final project in the programming design course I took. It is a game related to trivia of NTU, and the users needs to answer questions correctly to win the game.
* data analysis: It contains the datasets and the analysis work that I completed.
* pyqt-receipt: It is the receipt issue automation program prototype. The idea is to helps shops which still use the paper receipt to switch to electronic version.

I believe that there are improvement that can be made to the repository. More changes will be done later.
