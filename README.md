Hi, welcome to my repository! I am Franklin, currently a first year master student at Texas A&M University.

### Actively Learning:
* Operating System: By following through the course at the university.
* Software Engineering Concepts: Cooperate with a client and use agile methodology Agile Methodology to develop Ruby on Rails SaaS app.
* Quantum Algorithm: Following thorugh IBM Quantum Learning Courses and the "Applied Cryptography" course at the university

### More complete repository

The repository that I think is more complete is as follows:
* NTU_knowledge_king: It is the final project in the programming design course I took. It is a game related to trivia of NTU, and the users needs to answer questions correctly to win the game. The code is incorporated in other repositroy to become a GUI game.
* data analysis: It contains the datasets and the analysis work that I completed.
* pyqt-receipt: It is the receipt issue automation program prototype. The idea is to helps shops which still use the paper receipt to switch to electronic version.
* Dragon Slayer RPG: A web-based CLI game that is made by following through tutorials on websites. 

I believe that there are improvement that can be made to the repository. More changes will be done later.
